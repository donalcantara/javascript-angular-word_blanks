				Two kid ghosts, {{ ghost.Name1 }} and {{ ghost.Name2 }}, were up one night in their room talking about who could be more scary than the other.  {{ ghost.Name2 }} laughed and then flew through his bedroom wall and dissapeared.  All of a sudden, {{ ghost.Name1 }} heard a loud sound that went, {{ ghost.sound }}!! {{ ghost.Name1 }} turned to {{ ghost.Name2 }} and removed his {{ ghost.Bodypart1 }} and put it on his {{ ghost.Bodypart2 }}.
