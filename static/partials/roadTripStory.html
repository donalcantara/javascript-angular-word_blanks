				Three friends, {{ roadTrip.Name1 }}, {{ roadTrip.Name2 }} and {{ roadTrip.Name3 }}, went on a road trip to {{ roadTrip.Destination }}.  Two hours into their trip, their tire hit a pot hole and became flat.  Their treasure map led them to a deserted island in the middle of the Indian Ocean named "{{ roadTrip.Dog }} Island".  After many weeks at sea, they finally landed on {{ roadTrip.Dog }} Island.  After walking around for a while, they came across a mysterious animal that sorta looked like a {{ roadTrip.Animal }}.  They named the animal {{ roadTrip.Name4 }}. {{ roadTrip.Name4 }} was nice and let the three roadTrips pet him.  All of a sudden, {{ roadTrip.Name4 }} ran off into the forest.  The three roadTrips all chased after {{ roadTrip.Name4 }} and were led to a beautiful waterfall.  All the roadTrips dove into the water and swam across to see behind the waterfall.  Behind the waterfall, {{ roadTrip.Name1 }}, {{ roadTrip.Name2 }} and {{ roadTrip.Name3 }} saw a huge treasure chest filled with hundreds of pieces of {{ roadTrip.Candy }}.
