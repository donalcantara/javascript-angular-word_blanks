				Three timeTravels, {{ timeTravel.CurrentYear }}, {{ timeTravel.TravelYear }} and {{ timeTravel.Name3 }}, went on a voyage to find a buried treasure hidden behind a waterfall.  Their treasure map led them to a deserted island in the middle of the Indian Ocean named "{{ timeTravel.Dog }} Island".  After many weeks at sea, they finally landed on {{ timeTravel.TravelYear }} Island.  After walking around for a while, they came across a mysterious animal that sorta looked like a {{ timeTravel.Animal }}.  They named the animal {{ timeTravel.Period }}. {{ timeTravel.Name4 }} was nice and let the three timeTravels pet him.  All of a sudden, {{ timeTravel.Name4 }} ran off into the forest.  The three timeTravels all chased after {{ timeTravel.Name4 }} and were led to a beautiful waterfall.  All the timeTravels dove into the water and swam across to see behind the waterfall.  Behind the waterfall, {{ timeTravel.Name1 }}, {{ timeTravel.Name2 }} and {{ timeTravel.Name3 }} saw a huge treasure chest filled with hundreds of pieces of {{ timeTravel.Candy }}.
